## Welcome to the Book Search Engine

The book search engine is for readers of all types who want to search for new books so that they can keep a list of what books to purchase. This search engine is perfect as when the engine is loaded, the user is presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button. When the Search for Books menu option is clicked on, then the user is presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button. When the user is not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button, then they are presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site. Also, when clicked on the Login/Signup menu option, a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up. Under Signup, the user is presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button. Under Login, the user is presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button. Furthermore, when the user enters a valid email address and creates a password then clicks on the signup button, they have an account created and are logged in to the site. Another great feature is that when the user is logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button, then they are presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to the account. The book's information is all saved to the account when the save button is clicked on. All books and their information is saved to the users account with each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from my account. When the remove button is clicked on, then the book is deleted from the saved books list. Lastly, when the user clicks on the Logout button, then they are logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button. Overall, the Book Search Engine is a fantasic way for avid book readers to keep track of their favourite books for future purchases and more!
